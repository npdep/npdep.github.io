**Disclaimer** 

All tools developed and made available through NPDEP may only be used for academic purposes or with consent and are only intended for defensive purposes in order to evaluate your own security measures.

**Introduction**

NPDEP (Network Protocol Data Exfiltration Project) is a toolkit aimed at simulating data exfiltration scenarios across various network protocols. By providing configurable tools to replicate data leaks, NPDEP enables security researchers and IT administrators to test, evaluate, and improve defenses against unauthorized data exfiltration. This project emphasizes modularity, allowing users to customize exfiltration methods, transmission protocols, and detection strategies.

**Project Goals**

NPDEP is designed to:

- **Simulate Real-World Exfiltration Scenarios:** By offering configurable client and server modules, NPDEP replicates a variety of data exfiltration tactics across multiple protocols.
- **Support Defensive Measures:** Security teams can use NPDEP to test and fine-tune their detection systems, such as IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) and DLP (Data Loss Prevention) systems.
- **Provide Educational Value:** NPDEP serves as a valuable tool for academic research and training, helping cybersecurity professionals understand the mechanisms of data exfiltration through network protocols.
